Hi, I'm Dennis! I'm a data scientist who is passionate about using machine learning to bring ideas to life and solve complex problems. Recently, I've been interested in ML/DL applications in music and generative language models. In my pinned repositories, you'll find a collection of personal projects that I maintain:

- [Automated Chorus Detection](https://github.com/dennisvdang/chorus-detection): A convolutional recurrent neural network model and audio signal processing pipeline that locates choruses in songs.
- [Indeed-Job-Scraper](https://github.com/dennisvdang/indeed-job-scraper): A Python CLI tool to scrape Indeed job listings (including full descriptions, salaries, dates, URLs), filter by remote and job type, and export neatly formatted CSV data for analysis.
- [Question-Answering Information Retrieval System](https://github.com/dennisvdang/QA-Retrieval-System): A fine-tuned DistilBERT model trained to answer customer queries about company products.
- [Collection of case studies](https://github.com/dennisvdang/Springboard-Portfolio): Case studies where I apply various machine learning techniques (e.g. random forests and XGBoost for customer churn prediction) to real-world problems across different industries.

If you find value in any of my projects or insights, feel free to star the relevant repositories or follow me. I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and learn from each other!
